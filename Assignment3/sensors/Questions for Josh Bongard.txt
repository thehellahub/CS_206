Questions for Josh Bongard


Assignment 2 + 3:

1.) Why is it that when the torso is the root (the first link), the hinges don't work properly?
		When I set back leg as root, it does?
			This goes against the instruction of Assignment2 (#46 part c)
				Demo generate.py from Assignment3 with each Create_Robot method to illustrate


2.) Why is it that when the BackLeg is the "root" (the first link created), the touch sensor still provides information?
	This goes against the description in Assignment 3 "sensors" #11
