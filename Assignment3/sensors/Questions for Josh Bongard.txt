Questions for Josh Bongard


Assignment 2 + 3 + 4:


Assignment 2
1.) Why is it that when the torso is the root (the first link), the hinges don't work properly?
		When I set back leg as root, it does?
			This goes against the instruction of Assignment2 (#46 part c)
				Demo generate.py from Assignment3 sensors with each Create_Robot method to illustrate



nromal joit on x axis (1,0,0)


2.) In instances where I want to create multiple robots via only defining the coordinate of the root node/link per robot, is it still possible to do this even though it appears I have to use absolute coordinates for the Torso_FrontLeg joint? How would this work?


Assignment 3
3.) Why is it that when the BackLeg is the "root" (the first link created), the touch sensor still provides information?
	This goes against the description in Assignment 3 "sensors" #11






Assignment 4

4.) Assignment 4, step 7 -- should this be "robotId"? instead of "robot"?


Quiz 5:

XOR has 6 synapses.. Fitness landscape dimension is N+1 where N = # synapses.. So it should be 7
40:15-40:30
Possible answers: 
11, 9, 6, 10

Is it bc of the 6 synapses + 4 fitness dimensions for each outcome? == 10?


thresholds for 3 activation functions

N can be traits, genes, all things about phenotype (things were going to evolve)
6 weights + 3 thresholds values = 9 genes total + 1 fitness dimension = 10
